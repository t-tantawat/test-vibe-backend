# Expense Tracker Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Vite + React + TypeScript single-page application for tracking personal income and expenses. The default route renders a dashboard that surfaces current balance, income, and expense totals, along with filtering tools, CSV export, and a Recharts-powered monthly overview. All transaction data persists locally in the browser via `localStorage`, making the app fully client-side with no backend dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard summary** displaying total balance, income, and expenses at a glance.
- **Transaction management** with shadcn dialog for adding and editing entries, plus inline delete actions.
- **Filtering and export** tools covering category/date filters and CSV export with toast feedback.
- **Monthly visualization** using Recharts to plot income vs. expenses for the current month.
- **Local persistence** handled by a custom `useTransactions` hook that syncs transactions to `localStorage`.

## Run Locally

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed (the project uses npm scripts by default).

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173) to view the app. While the dev server is running, edits to the `src` directory hot-reload in the browser.

## GitHub Copilot Guidelines

- Treat Copilot suggestions as draftsâ€”review for correctness, security, and design consistency before accepting.
- Prefer prompting Copilot with clear function and test intentions so generated code includes validation paths.
- Keep domain logic transparent; avoid accepting opaque code blocks that you cannot explain to reviewers.
- Run relevant tests or manual checks after inserting Copilot code to confirm behavior matches project expectations.
- Remove unused imports, variables, or placeholder code that Copilot may include to keep the codebase tidy.
